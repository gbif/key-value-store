# kvs-core
This module contains the main abstractions and utilities use by KV stores.

A [KeyValueStore](src/main/java/org/gbif/kvs/KeyValueStore.java) is generic stores that allow the retrieval of data based on a known key.
This interface does not impose a way of how the elements are stored, some implementation might decide to be read-only while others can
implement an internal lookup mechanism in the `get` method to allow a transparent and incremental data loading.

All the implementation are assumed to use the (SaltedKeyGenerator)[src/main/java/org/gbif/kvs/SaltedKeyGenerator.java] to provide a consistent distributed key in a cluster environment.

In the package [hbase](src/main/java/org/gbif/kvs/hbase), an implementation based on [Apache HBase](https://hbase.apache.org/) is provided.
The [HBaseStore](src/main/java/org/gbif/kvs/hbase/HBaseStore.java) implementation allows a more complex and flexible way of looking up and loading data incrementally.
In particular, a `loader' function has to be provided which is used internally to retrieve values from external sources and store them in the KV store.


## HBase table

It is recommended to enable bloom filters, snappy compression and fast diff for data block enconding.
The number of SPLITS must reflect the number of buckets used for the salted ket, for example if the number of bucket is 10, the HBase table must be created using the following command:

```
create 'geocode_kv', {NAME => 'v', BLOOMFILTER => 'ROW', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'FAST_DIFF', COMPRESSION => 'SNAPPY'},{SPLITS => ['1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9']}
```

## Build

To build, install and run tests, execute the Maven command:
